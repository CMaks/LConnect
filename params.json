Automatically Turns on Lights at Sunset\r\n2. Turns off lights a random time 6-9 hours later\r\n3. A Web Interface for monitoring and manual turning on and off lights\r\n4. Detects when a Light has burnt out\r\n5. Sends text messages when a light is out.\r\n6. Accounts for daylight savings time\r\n\r\n# Description:\r\nHave you ever went outside and noticed all your lawn lights were burnt out?   This happened to me a little while ago.  So I decided there had to be a better way and a perfect project for the Raspberry Pi.   This Raspberry Pi project is a simple solution that will ensure you have complete control of your lights, even when you aren't around.  Try this simple but powerful internet of things project using the Raspberry pi.        \r\n\r\nThe Rasberry pi will control all the turn on and off of lights and will continually monitor the system power to determine if a light is not working.  On the event a light is not working or burnt out, a text message will be sent to the phone number of your choice telling you of the problem.\r\n\r\nThrough a web application, you can remotely monitor the status and control the turn on and off of the system.  Otherwise, the Raspberry pi will turn on your lights exactly at sunset each night and will turn them off a random time between 6 and 9 hours later.    \r\n\r\n# Web Application:\r\nThe web application, hosted by the Raspberry Pi, gives a status of the system.   The Lights On button is used to turn on and off the lights.  Text messages tell when the lights will be turned on and off next.  there is a current monitor that shows represents the current being used right now by the system. A calibrate button (no implemented yet) will be used to calibrate the system when it first turns on.  \r\n\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/LConnect/blob/master/webpage_shot.png \"web page screen shot\")\r\n\r\n# Block Diagram\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/LConnect/blob/master/blockdiagram.png \"System Block Diagram\")\r\n## Current Senor Board\r\nThe current sensor board will monitor the AC primary of the Lawn Light system.   A current transformer monitors the signal and converts the signal into a low voltage AC wave that the MCP3008 10Bit ADC can read.    The ADC reads the AC signal many times to find the peak value.  This peak value represents the power in the system.   \r\n## Relay Board\r\nThe HOT Wire of the Lawn Lights is controled by a high current and voltage relay.  the Raspberry Pi can drive the relay directly using the low current relay windings.\r\n## RPi Power Supply\r\nA 2 Amp power supply is recommended.  This power supply is always on and provides power to the Rasberry Pi and all the other LawnConnect Control circuitry.\r\n## Raspberry Pi\r\nA model B+ is used.   This Raspberry Pi needs to be setup with Raspbian distribution and to auto connect to the wifi system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n# Wiring Diagram:\r\nThis is how the Raspberry Pi is connected to the sensor board schematic and the relay board\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/LConnect/blob/master/WiringDiagram.png \"wiring diagram\")\r\n\r\n# BOM:\r\nThe major components for the project are listed below\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/LConnect/blob/master/BOM.png \"BOM\")\r\n\r\n# Sensor Board Schematic\r\nThe current sensor board is used to take the secondary of the current sensor and using a MCP3008 10bit ADC, convert into a digital signal that can be sampled by the Raspberry Pi\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/LConnect/blob/master/LawnConnect-CurrentSensor.png \"Current Sensor\")\r\n\r\n# Software\r\nThe software uses a python program to monitor the current through a SPI interface and the relays through simple GPIO pins.   The simple python web server, (i.e. `python -m CGIHTTPServer 8010`) is used to service web requests.  The client webpage uses javascript to monitor user inputs and output data from the monitor program.   Communication between the web server and the main program is performed by datafiles. \r\n\r\nThe setup is straighforward.  You need to setup the Rasbperry Pi to automatically connect to your wifi system.  Then you also need to be able to access the Raspberry pi as a headless system.   There are plenty of guides available on the internet.  The key is that you can log into the system via `ssh pi@xxx.xxx.1.xxx` where `xxx.xxx.1.xxx` is the IP address of your Raspberry Pi.  \r\n\r\nDownload the github software into the `/home/pi` directory.  \r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/drkmsmithjr/LConnect.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit and setup the crontab to automatically start the boot.sh script.\r\n```\r\ncrontab -e\r\n```\r\nedit this file with the following command\r\n```\r\n@reboot  /home/pi/LConnect/boot.sh\r\n```\r\nReboot the system to get things started.\r\n```\r\nsudo reboot\r\n```\r\nOpen a browser and find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi to access the webpage.   You need the :8010 port extension to access the browser\r\n```\r\nRPIADDRESS:8010/LawnConnectIndex.html\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Twillo Account Setup\r\nThe LawnConnect will sent an SMS message to your cell phone using Twillo Account.   You will need to get a Free Twillo Account at `https://www.twilio.com`.   After getting an account, get the twillo Phone Number, Account Number, and Token and place them into the twilloaccount.py file.  this file is not in the Git download but can easily be generated as follows:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\n# where to put the twillo account information\r\nTaccount= 'twillo_account'\r\nTtoken ='twillo_token'\r\nTnumber = 'twillo number'\r\nTo_number = 'Number to Call'\r\n```\r\nsave this `twilloaccount.py` file into the `/home/pi/LConnect` directory\r\n\r\nYou are all set.  Good Luck and let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThe webpage for the project is located at https://drkmsmithjr.github.io/LConnect\r\n",
