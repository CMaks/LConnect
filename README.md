# Description:
Have you ever went outside and noticed all your lawn lights were burnt out?   This happened to me a little while ago.  So I decided there had to be a better way and a perfect project for the Raspberry Pi.   This Raspberry Pi project is a simple solution that will ensure you have complete control of your lights, even when you aren't around.  Try this simple but powerful internet of things project using the Raspberry pi.        

The Rasberry pi will control all the turn on and off of lights and will continually monitor the system power to determine if a light is not working.  On the event a light is not working or burnt out, a text message will be sent to the phone number of your choice telling you of the problem.

Through a web application, you can remotely monitor the status and control the turn on and off of the system.  Otherwise, the Raspberry pi will turn on your lights exactly at sunset each night and will turn them off a random time between 6 and 9 hours later.
